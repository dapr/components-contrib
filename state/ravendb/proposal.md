# About Raven DB

[RavenDB](https://ravendb.net/about) is document NoSQL database that supports ACID.
We have over 1000 organizations that use RavenDB from startups to Fortune 500 companies like JetBrains,
Toyota and Verizon just to name a few.

# Motivation

We got feature request from some of our clients to implement Dapr State store & IO bindings.
Their project was growing in size, and they started rolling out more and more microservices and wanted to use Dapr.

We see that supporting RaveDb inside Dapr ecosystem as beneficial to both sides.

## Technical spec
