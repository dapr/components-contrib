    description: |
      TTL duration for stream entries. Entries older than this duration will be evicted.
      This is an approximate value, as it's implemented using Redis stream's MINID trimming with the '~' modifier.
      The actual retention may include slightly more entries than strictly defined by the TTL,
      as Redis optimizes the trimming operation for efficiency by potentially keeping some additional entries.
