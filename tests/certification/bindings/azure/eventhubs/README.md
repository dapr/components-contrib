   - Confirm that all expected messages were received

- Test sending /receiving data multiple partitions/sender and receivers
   - Start an app with 1 sender and 1 receiver
   - Send data from 2 partitions 
   - Sends 100+ unique messages
   - Simulates periodic errors
   - Confirm that all expected messages were received
   - Confirm  messages were received from all partitions

- Test reconnection
   - Start an app with 1 senders and 1 receivers
   - Send 100+ unique messages from 1 sender
   - Interrupt the connection
   - Confirm that all expected messages were received by respective receiver

- IoT hub testing
   - Move existing IoT test from integration to conformance test 
  
- Auth testing
   - Test connection string based authentication mechanism
   - Test service principal based authentication mechanism
