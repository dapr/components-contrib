          Must be set to `true` to enable the component to retrieve access tokens from Azure AD.
          This authentication method only works with Azure Database for PostgreSQL databases.

        description: |
          The connection string for the PostgreSQL database
          This must contain the user, which corresponds to the name of the user created inside PostgreSQL that maps to the Azure AD identity; this is often the name of the corresponding principal (e.g. the name of the Azure AD application). This connection string should not contain any password.

    type: string

    description: |
      Name of the table Dapr uses to store a few metadata properties.

  - name: cleanupIntervalInSeconds
    required: false
    description: |
      Interval, in seconds, to clean up rows with an expired TTL.
      Setting this to values <=0 disables the periodic cleanup.

    description: |
      Maximum number of connections pooled by this component.

    type: number
  - name: connectionMaxIdleTime
    required: false
    description: |
      Max idle time before unused connections are automatically closed in the
      connection pool. By default, there's no value and this is left to the
      database driver to choose.
    example:  "5m"
    type: duration
  - name: queryExecMode
    required: false
    description: |
      Controls the default mode for executing queries. By default Dapr uses the extended protocol and automatically prepares and caches prepared statements.
      However, this may be incompatible with proxies such as PGBouncer. In this case it may be preferrable to use `exec` or `simple_protocol`.

      - "cache_statement"

      - "describe_exec"
      - "exec"
