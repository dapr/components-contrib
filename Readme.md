The purpose of Components Contrib is to provide open, community driven reusable components for building distributed applications.
These components are being used by the [Dapr](https://github.com/dapr/dapr) project, but are separate and decoupled from it.

Using components developers can interact with bindings, state stores, messaging systems and more without caring about the underlying implementation.

Available component types:

* [Input/Output Bindings](bindings/Readme.md)
* [Pub Sub](pubsub/Readme.md)
* [State Stores](state/Readme.md)
* [Secret Stores](secretstores/Readme.md)
* [Tracing Exporters](exporters/Readme.md)

For documentation on how components are being used in Dapr in a language/platform agnostic way, visit [Dapr Docs](https://github.com/dapr/docs).
