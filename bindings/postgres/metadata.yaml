          Must be set to `true` to enable the component to retrieve access tokens from Azure AD.
          This authentication method only works with Azure Database for PostgreSQL databases.

        description: |
          The connection string for the PostgreSQL database
          This must contain the user, which corresponds to the name of the user created inside PostgreSQL that maps to the Azure AD identity; this is often the name of the corresponding principal (e.g. the name of the Azure AD application). This connection string should not contain any password.

        description: |
          The connection string for the PostgreSQL database
          This must contain the user, which corresponds to the name of the user created inside PostgreSQL that maps to the AWS IAM policy. This connection string should not contain any password. Note that the database name field is denoted by dbname with AWS.

      Max idle time before unused connections are automatically closed in the

    type: duration
  - name: queryExecMode
    required: false
    description: |
      Controls the default mode for executing queries. By default Dapr uses the extended protocol and automatically prepares and caches prepared statements.
      However, this may be incompatible with proxies such as PGBouncer. In this case it may be preferrable to use `exec` or `simple_protocol`.

      - "cache_statement"
      - "cache_describe"
      - "describe_exec"
      - "exec"
