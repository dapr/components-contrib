    description: |
      Amount of time in seconds that a message is hidden from receive requests after 
      it is sent to a subscriber.
    type: number
    default: '10'
    example: '10'
  - name: messageReceiveLimit
    required: false
    description: |
      Maximun number of attempts the message will be re-delivered after processing failures.
      The sqsDeadLettersQueueName is a SQS dead-letters queue to move the message to
      once the maximun number of attempts have been reached.
    type: number
    default: '10'
    example: '10'
  - name: messageRetryLimit
    required: false
    description: |
      Number of times to resend a message after processing of that message fails 
      before removing that message from the queue.
    type: number
    default: '10'

    required: false
    description: |
      Name of the dead letters queue for this application.
    example: '"myapp-dlq"'
    type: string
  - name: messageWaitTimeSeconds
    required: false
    description: |
      The duration (in seconds) for which the call waits for a message to arrive
      in the queue before returning. If a message is available, the call returns
      sooner than messageWaitTimeSeconds. If no messages are available and the
      wait time expires, the call returns successfully with an empty list of messages.
    type: number
    default: '1'
    example: '1'
  - name: messageMaxNumber
    required: false
    description: |

  - name: fifo
    description: |
      Use SQS FIFO queue to provide message ordering and deduplication.
      See `Amazon SQS FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues` further details.

      title: "Amazon SQS FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues"

    type: bool
    default: 'false'
    example: '"true", "false"'
  - name: fifoMessageGroupID
    required: false
    description: |
      If fifo is enabled, instructs Dapr to use a custom Message Group ID 
      for the pubsub deployment. This is not mandatory as Dapr creates a
      custom Message Group ID for each producer, thus ensuring ordering
      of messages per a Dapr producer.
      See Message Group ID Property documentation.

      SNS do not get created automatically.
    type: bool
    default: 'false'
    example: '"true", "false"'
  - name: disableDeleteOnRetryLimit
    description: |
      When set to true, after retrying and failing of messageRetryLimit
      times processing a message, reset the message visibility timeout
      so that other consumers can try processing, instead of deleting
      the message from SQS (the default behvior).
    type: bool
    default: 'false'
    example: '"true", "false"'
  - name: assetsManagementTimeoutSeconds
    required: false
    description: |
      Amount of time in seconds, for an AWS asset management operation,
      before it times out and cancelled. Asset management operations 
      are any operations performed on STS, SNS and SQS, except message
      publish and consume operations that implement the default Dapr
      component retry behavior. The value can be set to any non-negative
      float/integer.
    type: number
    default: '1'
    example: '0.5, 10'
  - name: concurrencyMode
    required: false
    description: |
      When messages are received in bulk from SQS, call the subscriber
      sequentially (“single” message at a time), or
      concurrently (in “parallel”).
