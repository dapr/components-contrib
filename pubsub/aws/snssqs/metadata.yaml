  - name: messageVisibilityTimeout
    required: false
    description: |
      Amount of time in seconds that a message is hidden from receive requests after 
      it is sent to a subscriber.
    type: number
    default: '10'
    example: '10'
  - name: messageReceiveLimit
    required: false
    description: |
      Number of times a message is received, after processing of that message fails,
      that once reached, results in removing of that message from the queue. 
      If sqsDeadLettersQueueName is specified, messageReceiveLimit is the number of
      times a message is received, after processing of that message fails, that once
      reached, results in moving of the message to the SQS dead-letters queue.
    type: number
    default: '10'
    example: '10'
  - name: messageRetryLimit
    required: false
    description: |
      Number of times to resend a message after processing of that message fails 
      before removing that message from the queue.
    type: number
    default: '10'
    example: '10'
  - name: sqsDeadLettersQueueName
    required: false
    description: |
      Name of the dead letters queue for this application.
    example: '"myapp-dlq"'
    type: string
  - name: messageWaitTimeSeconds
    required: false
    description: |
      The duration (in seconds) for which the call waits for a message to arrive
      in the queue before returning. If a message is available, the call returns
      sooner than messageWaitTimeSeconds. If no messages are available and the
      wait time expires, the call returns successfully with an empty list of messages.
    type: number
    default: '1'
    example: '1'
  - name: messageMaxNumber
    required: false
    description: |
      Maximum number of messages to receive from the queue at a time.
    type: number
    default: '10'
    example: '10'
  - name: fifo
    description: |
      Use SQS FIFO queue to provide message ordering and deduplication.
      See further details about SQS FIFO:
      https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues.html
    type: bool
    default: 'false'
    example: '"true", "false"'
  - name: fifoMessageGroupID
    required: false
    description: |
      If fifo is enabled, instructs Dapr to use a custom Message Group ID 
      https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/using-messagegroupid-property.html
      for the pubsub deployment. This is not mandatory as Dapr creates a
      custom Message Group ID for each producer, thus ensuring ordering
      of messages per a Dapr producer. 
    example: '"app1-mgi"'
    type: string
  - name: disableEntityManagement
    description: |
      When set to true, SNS topics, SQS queues and the SQS subscriptions to
      SNS do not get created automatically.

    default: 'false'
    example: '"true", "false"'
  - name: disableDeleteOnRetryLimit
    description: |
      When set to true, after retrying and failing of messageRetryLimit
      times processing a message, reset the message visibility timeout
      so that other consumers can try processing, instead of deleting
      the message from SQS (the default behvior).
    type: bool
    default: 'false'
    example: '"true", "false"'
  - name: assetsManagementTimeoutSeconds
    required: false
    description: |
      Amount of time in seconds, for an AWS asset management operation,
      before it times out and cancelled. Asset management operations 
      are any operations performed on STS, SNS and SQS, except message

      component retry behavior. The value can be set to any non-negative
      float/integer.

    default: '1'
    example: '0.5, 10'
